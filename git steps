use mkdir to creat a folder in repo if needed
git config --global user.name "pratik chaudhari"   #let the git know your name and email
git config --global user.email "pratikc191098@gmail.com"
git init #creating a newrepo

git status
git add . #adding all the content of folder to staging area before commiting
you can check status again by git status
git commit -m "initial commit" #comitting
git log #can be use to check the no of commits or previous commits
git log #gives the code of specfic commits
git checkout paste the code of commit here on which you want to go or jump

git checkout master  #takes you to the master branch

git branch <branch name> #use to creat the new branch 
git checkout #is basically used to jump frm branch to branch
git branch   #shows the branch lists
we can make a branch inside of a branch and
git checkout -b <branch name>  # by this you can make a new branch and directly switched to that branch

git merge <branch name you want to merge whith the existing>  
.gitignore #file can be made and names of the other files can be mentioned in it which you want to be untracked or ignored by git


############now comes the part of github repo##############
1st login github and make a new repository
giv it a name as same as a local repository(not compulsary)

git remote -v   #shows the origin to pull and push the data 

git remote add origin https://github.com/pratikc191098/<name of the new repo>   # this sets the origin from where fetch and push the data

git branch -M master 

git push -u origin master #if this didnt work

git push --set-upstream origin main #try this

while pushing it can show some login error and permission denied which is because of the login of a previous person and it the login details of that person is saved in a keychain somewhere , so if this happens you have to deleet that saved login infirmation of that person

finally put id and pass (use token compulsary for id and pass)
